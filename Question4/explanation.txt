1. I created the script emailcleaner.sh to process the emails.txt file.

2. I used grep with regular expressions to extract valid email addresses matching the required format.

3. Valid emails were stored in valid.txt, and invalid ones were stored in invalid.txt.

4. I used sort and uniq to remove duplicate entries from valid.txt.

5. The script successfully separated valid and invalid email addresses.
