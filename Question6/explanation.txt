1. I created the script metrics.sh to analyze the text file input.txt.

2. I used tr to separate words and remove special characters.

3. I used awk and sort to determine the longest and shortest words.

4. I calculated the average word length using arithmetic operations in awk.

5. I used sort, uniq, and wc to count the total number of unique words.

6. The script correctly displayed all required metrics.
