1. I created the script patterns.sh to classify words based on vowel and consonant patterns.

2. I used tr to convert all text to lowercase for case-insensitive checking.

3. I used grep with regular expressions to extract words containing only vowels into vowels.txt.

4. I extracted words containing only consonants into consonants.txt.

5. I identified words starting with a consonant and containing both vowels and consonants into mixed.txt.

6. The script successfully categorized words into separate files.
