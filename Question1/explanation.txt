1. I created the script analyze.sh using nano editor. The script checks whether the argument provided is a file or directory.

2. I used chmod +x analyze.sh to make the script executable. The ls -l command confirmed execution permission was granted.

3. I created a sample file using echo to test the script functionality.

4. When I executed the script with a file argument, it displayed the number of lines, words, and characters using the wc command.

5. When I executed the script with a directory argument, it displayed the total number of files and the number of .txt files using find and wc.

6. I tested invalid argument conditions, and the script displayed appropriate error messages.
