1. I created the script validate_results.sh to read student data from marks.txt using a while loop.

2. I used IFS=',' to properly separate comma-separated values.

3. For each student, I checked if marks were less than 33 to determine failed subjects.

4. I counted students who failed in exactly one subject and those who passed all subjects.

5. I used arithmetic operations and conditionals to categorize students correctly.

6. The script displayed both individual student results and total counts for each category.
