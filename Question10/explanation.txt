1. I wrote a C program demonstrating signal handling using signal().

2. The parent process runs indefinitely in a loop.

3. One child process sends SIGTERM after 5 seconds using kill().

4. Another child process sends SIGINT after 10 seconds.

5. The parent handles SIGTERM and SIGINT differently using custom handler functions.

6. The parent exits gracefully after receiving SIGINT.

7. I compiled and executed the program to verify signal handling behavior.
