1. I created the script bg_move.sh to move all files from a given directory into a subdirectory named backup.

2. I used mkdir -p backup to ensure the backup directory is created only if it does not already exist.

3. I used Bash conditional pattern matching with regular expressions ([[ $word =~ ... ]]) to identify words containing only vowels and store them in vowels.txt.

4. I displayed the PID of each background move operation using the $! variable, which stores the process ID of the most recent background process.

5. I used the wait command to ensure the parent process waits for all background processes to complete before exiting.

6. After execution, I verified that all files were successfully moved into the backup directory.
