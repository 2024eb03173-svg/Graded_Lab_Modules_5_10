1. I wrote a C program that creates multiple child processes using fork().

2. Each child process terminates immediately after execution.

3. The parent process uses wait() to clean up terminated child processes.

4. The parent prints the PID of each cleaned child process.

5. This prevents zombie processes from remaining in the system.

6. I compiled the program using gcc and verified correct execution.
