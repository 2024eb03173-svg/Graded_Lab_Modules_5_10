1. I created the log analyzer script that accepts a log file name as a command-line argument.

2. The script checks whether exactly one argument is provided and verifies that the file exists and is readable.

3. I used grep to count the total number of log entries and specifically count INFO, WARNING, and ERROR messages.

4. I used tail -1 to display the most recent ERROR message.

5. The script generates a summary report file named logsummary_<date>.txt using output redirection.

6. I tested the script with valid and invalid inputs to ensure proper error handling.
