1. I created the log analyzer script that accepts a log file name as a command-line argument.

2. The script checks whether exactly one argument is provided and verifies that the file exists and is readable.

3. I used grep -c to count log entries containing the levels INFO, WARNING, and ERROR, and to determine the number of occurrences for each log level separately.

4. I used tail -1 to display the most recent ERROR message.

5. The script generates a summary report file named logsummary_<date>.txt using output redirection.

6. I tested the script with valid and invalid inputs to ensure proper error handling.
